		<h2>NBA History</h2>
		<p>The NBA was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the NBA. Since then, the league has expanded to include 30 teams, and has become one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world. The NBA is known for its high-scoring games, fast-paced action, and some of the most talented athletes in the world.</p>
